# PolyQuest

PolyQuest is a prototype of a click-to-move RPG that showcases the fundamental systems for a larger project in development. Built as a gameplay demo, this early version introduces players to a small slice of the worldâ€”complete with dialogue, a basic inventory, and a quest system.

In the demo, players explore a quiet town under threat and speak with the Captain of the Guard to uncover their first quest: tracking down and defeating a group of bandits camped just outside the village. Core mechanics like movement, NPC interaction, and combat with enemy AI are all featured to demonstrate the game's potential.

This version of PolyQuest sets the groundwork for a more expansive RPG experience, with plans to evolve the world, deepen the questlines, and introduce more systems like character progression, branching dialogue, and a dynamic world state.
