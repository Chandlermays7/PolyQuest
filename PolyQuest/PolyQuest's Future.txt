Features I want to add next:

* Expand the Leveling system with attributes and abilities (magic spells?)
* Promote the NPC in front of the blue tent to be a Merchant
* Implement random drops from killing enemies, and the ability to drop items in the world
* More maps!
* More enemy types? Boss encounters?
